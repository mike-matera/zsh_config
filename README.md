# My ZSH Setup

This repo helps me synchronize my ZSH setup on all of my various machines. One thing that I don't like about ZSH is that the defaults aren't that good. It's a pretty rinky dink way to synchronize dot files. I've added my ~/.emacs for fun.

Here's how to set it up:

```
git clone --recursive XXX
./zsh_config/setup.sh
```

It will move any conflicting files out of the way.
